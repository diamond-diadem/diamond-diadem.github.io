Ovito is a software for visualization and analysis of scientific data, primarily used in the field of molecular simulation and materials science. It offers advanced features for visualizing and interacting with complex data sets generated by numerical simulations. Ovito supports various output file formats from simulations, allowing researchers to visualize and analyze the structures, properties, and dynamics of materials at the atomic or molecular scale. In addition to its visualization capabilities, the software also provides analysis tools to extract quantitative information from the data, facilitating the understanding and interpretation of simulation results.

Ovito is developed, distributed, and supported by OVITO GmbH, a German startup. This software has been a valuable scientific tool in over 10,000 scientific studies to date (~6 new publications per day).
