**FEniCS** is an open-source software platform designed for the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) using finite element methods. It provides a comprehensive environment for defining, discretizing, and solving complex problems in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. FEniCS adopts an automated approach that allows users to specify high-level mathematical equations while leveraging efficient, optimized computations. The software comprises several integrated modules, including **DOLFIN**, a library for computation and mesh handling, and **UFL**, a language for defining weak forms. It is primarily written in C++ with user-friendly Python interfaces and supports parallel computing environments.
