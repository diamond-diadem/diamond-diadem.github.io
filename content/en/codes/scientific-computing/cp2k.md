**CP2K** is an open-source scientific software designed for atomistic simulations in the fields of chemistry, physics, and materials science. It is primarily used for molecular dynamics, electronic structure calculations, and other multi-scale methods such as QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics). CP2K is optimized for operation on high-performance parallel systems, making it efficient for large-scale complex simulations.

The software supports various methodologies, including density functional theory (DFT), classical force fields, and semi-empirical approaches. It provides flexibility in modeling through a modular infrastructure that allows the combination of different theoretical approaches and computational techniques. Typical applications include studying electronic properties, modeling chemical reactions, and simulating condensed matter and biological systems.
