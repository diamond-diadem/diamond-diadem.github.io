<!-- The layout: codes-home.html loads the three parts of this (long) markdown file, to be found in the same folder as this file: part-1.md part-2.md part-3-md -->

<!-- part-1.md contains the info at the beginning of the page, figure and link cards -->

<!-- part-2.md contains the table with all available codes (links) -->

<!-- part-3.md contains the shortcut to apptainer pull commands with the two synchronised <select> elements. It is very long, for there is actually 4 <select> elements: 2 for large screens and 2 for narrow screens (responsive design) -->

<!-- When adding a code to the website, part2.md and part3-md must be updated, in order to add the new code to the table and to the corresponding <select> element -->
