## Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials and Accessible Databases

#### Organisers

- **Magali BENOIT** (CEMES, CNRS, Toulouse)
- **Arthur FRANCE-LANORD** (CNRS)
- **Noel JAKSE** (Université Grenoble Alpes)
- **Antonino MARCO SAITTA** (IMPMC - Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC) - Paris)

Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have positioned themselves as a key tool for atomistic modeling in materials science. MLIPs cover an expansive range of systems, taking advantage of the highly accurate electronic structure calculations based on quantum mechanics, but at a significantly lower computational cost. They allow to scale up atomistic simulations to larger systems, longer timescales, and more complex phenomena; they therefore significantly contribute to the acceleration of the discovery of novel structural and functional materials, and in the advancements in our understanding of matter. Ground-breaking bodies of work have been published since the seminal work of Behler and Parrinello in 2007, transforming the field into a rapidly evolving research discipline. However, alongside these advancements, a crucial challenge emerges: the need for standardized protocols for MLIP generation and storage, as well as comprehensive, accessible databases for *ab initio* datasets.

**Location:** amphithéâtre Besson, campus Phelma, Batiment A, 1130 rue de la Piscine, 38400 Saint Martin d'Hères. Campus map <a href="https://dropsu.sorbonne-universite.fr/s/gdMJ2o5FZtKn48Z" target="_blank">here</a> (look for building A, Phelma campus):

How to reach the event? The airport shuttle will drop you at the Grenoble train station. From there, take tram B (towards "Gières, Plaine des Sports"), and stop at "Bibliothèques Universitaires". Walk north and reach Building A on the map.
