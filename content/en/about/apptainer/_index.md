Apptainer is a free and open-source computer program that performs operating system-level virtualization, also known as containerization. It is similar to Docker software.

Apptainer provides a containerization solution that enhances reproducibility in scientific computing and the high-performance computing (HPC) domain.

The need for reproducibility requires the ability to move applications from one system to another, and containers prove valuable in achieving this goal.

With Apptainer containers, developers can work in reproducible environments of their choice, and these complete environments can easily be copied and run on other platforms. For instance, a user can create a container on their personal computer and run it on a high-performance computing grid.
