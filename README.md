## What’s inside?

| Area | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `content/` | Markdown sources for the bilingual (English/French) site. Sections such as `codes/`, `workflows/`, `documentation/`, and ` news/` live here. |
| `config/` | Hugo + Doks configuration split by environment. `_default/params.yaml` is the main place to adjust global settings. |
| `assets/` | SCSS, JS, SVG, and image sources processed by Hugo Pipes. |
| `layouts/` | Template overrides that extend the [Doks/Thulite](https://getdoks.org) theme. |
| `static/` | Files served verbatim (downloads, images). |
| `public/` | Build output generated by Hugo; it is excluded from Git, regenerated on every build, and should never be edited directly. |
| `resources/` | Hugo’s generated cache (safe to delete locally). |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI pipelines for deployment and for protecting dependency manifests. |
