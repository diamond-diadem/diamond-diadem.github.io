## Contributing

Please read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting any contribution to the repository, and make sure to follow the guidelines there established. 

## Quick notes

- Files `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are not to be edited or modified. They contain the locked dependencies for the Node.js environment.
- Folder `public/` is auto-generated by Hugo at each build, and should never be edited directly. Edit the `content` files instead.
- Although possible to edit the files directly on GitHub, it's best practice to clone the repository, make any modification locally, start a local server to check everything went as expected, and then create a pull request so the admin can review and merge the contribution. A complete description on how to do this can be seen at the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

| Area                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content/`           | Markdown sources for the bilingual (English/French) site. Sections such as `codes/`, `workflows/`, `documentation/`, and ` news/` live here. |
| `config/`            | Hugo + Doks configuration split by environment. `_default/params.yaml` is the main place to adjust global settings.                          |
| `assets/`            | SCSS, JS, SVG, and image sources processed by Hugo Pipes.                                                                                    |
| `layouts/`           | Template overrides that extend the [Doks/Thulite](https://getdoks.org) theme.                                                                |
| `static/`            | Files served verbatim (downloads, images).                                                                                                   |
| `public/`            | Build output generated by Hugo; it is excluded from Git, regenerated on every build, and should never be edited directly.                    |
| `resources/`         | Hugo’s generated cache (safe to delete locally).                                                                                             |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI pipelines for deployment and for protecting dependency manifests.                                                                         |
