# [DIAMOND Website](https://diamond-diadem.github.io) - Source Repository for development and deployment on GitHub Pages

## The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), using the [Doks](https://getdoks.org) theme, from the [Thulite](https://thulite.io) frmaework, and powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

## Contributing

Before making any changes to the repository, please review and follow the guidelines in the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Quick notes
- Do not edit `package.json` or `package-lock.json`; these files manage and lock Node.js dependencies.
- The `public/` folder is automatically generated by Hugo during each build and should never be modified manually. Make changes in the `content/` directory instead.
- While GitHub’s web editor allows direct file edits, it is strongly recommended to clone the repository, make changes locally, preview them using a local server, and then submit a pull request. Detailed instructions are available in the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

### What's inside?

| Area                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content/`           | Markdown sources for the bilingual (English/French) site. Sections such as `codes/`, `workflows/`, `documentation/`, and ` news/` live here. |
| `config/`            | Hugo + Doks configuration split by environment. `_default/params.yaml` is the main place to adjust global settings.                          |
| `assets/`            | SCSS, JS, SVG, and image sources processed by Hugo Pipes.                                                                                    |
| `layouts/`           | Template overrides that extend the [Doks/Thulite](https://getdoks.org) theme.                                                                |
| `static/`            | Files served verbatim (downloads, images).                                                                                                   |
| `public/`            | Build output generated by Hugo; it is excluded from Git, regenerated on every build, and should never be edited directly.                    |
| `resources/`         | Hugo’s generated cache (safe to delete locally).                                                                                             |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI pipelines for deployment and for protecting dependency manifests.                                                                         |
